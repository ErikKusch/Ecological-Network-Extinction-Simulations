# Ecological Network Inference across Scales
Part of Chapter 2 of my PhD project.

## Abstract
Forecasting biodiversity and functioning changes to ecosystem composition and functioning under climate change requires using multi-species approaches that explicitly consider ecological interactions. Here, we propose a framework with which to incorporate considerations of (1) localised extinction risk proxies, (2) resilience mechanisms of ecological networks, and (3) extinction cascade directionality as a driving force of ecological change. These three aspects are seldomly considered when establishing ecosystems responses to climate change and biodiversity loss. Using this framework, we demonstrate that current practices may severely underpredict ecological change measured as loss of biodiversity and change in connectedness. Our novel framework which explicitly explores two-dimensional resilience landscapes defined by network resilience mechanisms (i.e., link loss sensitivity and realisation of rewiring potential) represents the most complete toolbox for assessment of vulnerability of ecological networks to extinction cascades. Ultimately, we propose that using localised extinction proxies, explicitly quantifying ecological network resilience through link-loss sensitivity and realisation of rewiring potential, as well as simulation of bidirectional extinction cascades will lead to improved capabilities of estimating ecosystem trajectories throughout the Anthropocene.

## Research Questions
How are extinction cascade severity and biodiversity loss affected by:
1. Choice of primary extinction?
2. Network resilience characteristics (i.e., link-loss sensitivity and rewiring probability threshold)
3. Directionality of extinction cascade

## Key Findings
1. Risk of primary extinction ought to be quantified using local extinction risk proxies rather than global assessments
2. Incorporating network resilience mechanisms allows the exploration of more realistic extinction cascade outcomes
3. Bidirectional extinction cascades lead to greater ecosystem level changes than bottom-up or top-down cascades. 

By implementing these guidelines, we conclusively show that current ecosystem forecast practices are likely to underpredict threats to ecosystems. While we have explored potential ecosystem projections rather than expected projections for each target ecosystem, our study framework represents a powerful approach to exploring more realistic ranges of future ecosystem scenarios than previous approaches. This new perspective will allow more effective targeting of conservation efforts.
